** Title
Mean-Variance Loss for Deep Age Estimation from a Face
** Author
Hongyu Pan, Hu Han, Shiguang Shan and Xilin Chen
** Published
CVPR 2018
** Code
None

* Paper Content
** Why
age regression or classification do not utilize the distrubutions robustness or ordinal information in age

** How
Use 3 loss
1. original cross_entropy loss
2. mean loss, softmax output * range_j
3. variance loss, shrinkt probabilities
   
** Results
Test in Morph II and FGNet
** Thoughts
1. softmax expectation from deep expection penalize ages differently
2. why use alexnet and vgg in 2018?
