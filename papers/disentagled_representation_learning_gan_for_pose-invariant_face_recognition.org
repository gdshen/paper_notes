* Paper Content
** Why
Motivation: to improve the performance of pose invariant face recognition

** What
1. using encode-decoder structure
2. add pose code to direct the decoder
3. support multiple images for testing.
   
** How
GAN strucuture similair zi2zi

** Results
Datasets used: multi-pie, cfp, IJB-A

** Thoughts
1. The true idea is to learn a representation without contains pose information.
2. traditional methods for face images with large pose
   1. face frontalization
   2. learn pose-invariant feature representation
3. they do not add constraints on pose in encoding network
4. It is pair learning, we still need the pose code for our training sets.
5. Could we acquire Multi-Pie and IJB-A datasets?
6. It not balanced for identify classification with real/fake classification.
7. can we replace the avgpool in the enc
8. A very big problem is that we may not access to the Multi-Pie datasets.
9. can we use U-net structure here?
10. how can we combine the renset/mobilenet structure with arcface loss here?
