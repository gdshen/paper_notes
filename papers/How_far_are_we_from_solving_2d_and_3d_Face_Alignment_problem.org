** Why
How far a deep neural network is from attaining close to saturating performance on 2D & 3D datasets.
** What
1. Create a baseline network to solve 2D facial landmark localization.
2. converted 2D landmarks into 3D landmarks, propose a 3D landmark datasets
3. training a neural network on this newly introduced 3D landmark datasets
4. evalute different factors that have effects on the performance of face alignment.
   
** How
1. HourGlass Network
2. hierarchical parallel & multi-scale block
3. FAN: face alignment network
4. LS3D-w: large scale 3d 

*** Metrics
$$NME = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{||x_k-y_k||_2}{d}$$

*** 2d & 3d face alignment network
four hourglass network, replace the bottleneck block

*** 2d to 3d convertor
using a network to convert, augment the input rgb channel with 68 channel indicating the landmark location.

** Thoughts
1. The relationship between human pose estimation and facial landmark localization is close.
2. This paper has cited many papers about human pose estimation.
3. heatmap regression
4. prior to the adventing of deep learning, landmark localization are largely based on cascaded regression methods.
5. What is the 2d synthetically expanded 2d facial landmark dataset. 300-W-LP, which is a synthetically datasets that expands 300-W.
6. 300-W datasets is a concatenation of a series of smaller datasets: LFPW, HELEN, AFW, iBUG where each image was reannotated in a consistent manner.
7. profile face: face shot in the side.
