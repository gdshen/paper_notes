** Why
WGAN-GP only enforces the Lipschitz continuity on concrete sample points.

** What
Propose a new regulation term call consistency term.

** How
$$L = \mathbb{E}_{\mathit{z}\sim \mathbb{P}_\mathit{z}}[D(G(\mathit{\boldsymbol z})] - \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{x}\sim \mathbb{P}_r}[D(\boldsymbol(x)] + \lambda_1GP|_{\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}} + \lambda_2CT|_{\boldsymbol{x}',\boldsymbol{x}''}$$

** Results
Semi-Supversied Learning shows high inception score.

** Thoughts
   hope to apply it into our gans frameworks.
