** Why
Sovling deep face recognition problem under open-set protocol, where ideal face features are expected to have smaller maximal intra-class distance than minimal inter-class distance under a suitably chosen metric space. Current few methods achieve this goal.
Combining Euclidean margin based losses with softmax loss causing imcompatible problems.

** What
1. Propose A-softmax loss.
2. adjust angular margin by a parameter $m$.
3. derive specific $m$ to approximate the ideal feature criterion.

** How
*** Modified Softmax
Constraint $|W|=1$ and $b = 0$

*** Angular Softmax
introduce an integer $m$, so the boundary becomes to $||x||(cos(m\theta_1) - cos(\theta_2)) = 0$

** Results

** Thoughts
1. close-set face recognition problem needs features to be separable, open-set face recognition needs features to be discriminative.
2. The features learned byu softmax loss have intrinsic angular distribution. (Considering the decision boundary $W_1X > W_2X$, which will cause the angular between the feature and weigth to be small)
3. The A-softmax loss may be used in general classification problems.

The relationship of many losses
Weiyang Liu is the first author of A-softmax Loss & L-softmax Loss
Yandong Wen is the second author of A-softmax Loss and the first author of the center Loss.
