* Paper Content
** Why
The decoder of GAN with encoder-decoder only see partial feature vectors.

** What
Propose to use another decoder to decode random generate features.

** How
tow path way gans structure

** Results
compare with DR-GAN, generated face images of same ids has smaller distances computed using facenet.
and has better visual effects.

** Thoughts
1. it doesnt focus on the discrimative feature, only on generative.
2. not obvious to improve the face recognition accuracy.
